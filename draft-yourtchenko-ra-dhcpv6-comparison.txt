    A comparison between the DHCPv6 and RA based host configuration
               draft-yourtchenko-ra-dhcpv6-comparison-00

Abstract

   This document attempts to make a balanced comparison between the RA-
   based and DHCPv6-based host configuration mechanisms.  It compares
   the two on different aspects, e.g: underlying media assumptions,
   coordination, locality, etc.  and highlights the strong and weak
   sides of both protocols for each scenario.

1.  Introduction

   IPv4 provided only one way of configuring the addresses and node
   parameters: DHCP.  Having no choice made the choice simple.

   IPv6 allows for a similar mode of operation with DHCPv6, but also
   introduces the mandatory Router Advertisements, which overlap in some
   functionality with DHCPv6 and replace some functionality of DHCPv4.
   This creates the problem: what is the best?  How do I know which of
   the two to use?  Since "the best" usually means "the best for me", it
   is an inherently locally-significant adjective.  A lot of arguments
   are not taking this into account, resulting in deadlock situations
   and mutual frustrations during the discussion.  The goal of this
   document is dissecting the technical properties of both address
   configuration mechanisms.  This should hopefully result in a more
   objective and technical analysis, and allow for a better judgement of
   which mechanism is "better" in each specific case.

   The author of the document does not take any side nor tries to
   promote one approach over the other.  If you, the reader, spot any

   could be corrected.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Comparison

2.1.  Asymmetric standards requirements

   Not all standards reference RA/DHCP equally - e.g. on 3G/LTE the
   standard requires the use of SLAAC (thus, RA).

   RFC 6434 in section 5.9.2 "IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"
   defines SLAAC a MUST, while DHCPv6 is defined as SHOULD by sections
   7.2.1, "Other Configuration Information", and section 5.9.5,
   "Stateful Address Autoconfiguration (DHCPv6)".

2.2.  Acknowledged vs. Unacknowledged

   DHCPv6 needs at least 2 packets (If Rapid Commit is being used.  If
   it is not used, then 4 packets).  RA can potentially work with just
   one packet - however the operation of it will be not optimal.

   RA strength: it is quicker.

   DHCPv6 Plus: works well in the noisy/lossy environments; DHCPv6
   minus: takes at least 1 RTT to the server.

   There is one additional reason for DHCPv6 to be slower.  RFC3315
   states: "A client MUST collect Advertise messages for the first RT
   seconds, unless it receives an Advertise message with a preference
   value of 255.".  Since most of the time the preference in DHCPv6
   messages is not 255, compliant nodes will be at least 1 second (+/-
   up to 0.1 sec) slower than those using RA - as RT is calculated based
   on SOL_TIMEOUT value.

2.3.  Client initiated vs. server initiated

   Despite the division above, RA can be client-initiated, to some
   extent, with RS, and DHCPv6 can be server-initiated, to some extent,
   with "Reconfigure" messages.

   If we treat these as "nudge" messages, the behavior of the sending
   and receiving parties is similar - the "nudge" message causes the
   orderly protocol exchange to occur before the due time.

Internet-Draft          RA and DHCPv6 comparison           December 2013


   The part that is different, though, is that RA, due to its "send
   once, receive many" nature, can aggregate the "nudge" messages, so
   intuitively seems best for a scenario with a very large number of the
   hosts, as it should have self-stabilizing properties compared to
   DHCPv6.

   This "self-stabilizing" property intuitively seems to make RA safer
   to use, IFF it is used in purely "multicast" fashion.  However, the
   L2 media interaction concerns might affect and even cancel out this
   property, depending on the environment.

2.4.  Centralized coordination vs. distributed coordination

   RA, due to its "send once, receive many" nature, in its pure form
   necessarily can not dictate a per-client settings, but rather can
   only advise the domain the client would pick from (SLAAC).

   DHCPv6 on the other hand, due to its p2p nature is by default well
   suited for individual per-client tweaking.

   The distributed nature can be a blessing if you do not care about who
   gets which address and a curse if you need to strictly account
   everyone.

   NB: address assignment does not mean that the hosts will always use
   those addresses - e.g. it's perfectly possible to statically
   configure a different address, but we only talk about homogenous
   standards-compliant well-behaved hosts for simplicity sake).

   That's why the title of this section does not use the word "control"
   but rather uses the word "coordination".

2.5.  Single Source of Truth vs. Multiple sources

   The DHCPv6 model requires the client to choose only one of the
   advertise messages that it receives.  When using RA, the client can
   combine information from multiple sources.

   RA based configuration gives hosts a lot of flexibility.

   On the other hand, DHCPv6 aims to tightly control the behavior of the
   hosts and have a highly predictable configuration of the network as a
   whole.

   An example where this difference might be crucial is a segment with
   two routers, aware of each other's state.  If server A goes down,
   then server B, when using RA-based mechanism, can just send a message
   with a lifetime of zero.  The DHCPv6-based implementation of this



Yourtchenko               Expires June 19, 2014                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          RA and DHCPv6 comparison           December 2013


   scenario would need to be more involved - if the client trusted the
   server A to begin with, it will not listen to notifications from B -
   so B will need to spoof A in some way.

   However, at the same time this ease with which one device can
   instruct the hosts on behalf of the other can be also considered a
   weakness in a stricter environment - and require additional security
   measures in place so that a malicious host do not impersonate a
   router.

2.6.  The amount of server-side state

   RA in its pure form is inherently stateless - there is no per-client
   information stored on the sending router.  This eases things like
   redundancy and failover compared to DHCPv6.

   DHCPv6 in its stateless incarnation also does not keep the state -
   however, in the scenario of the DHCPv6 server sending the RECONFIGURE
   message to the client, a DHCPv6 server must keep some knowledge of
   the client - which means it might need to keep some state.  Thus if
   there is a requirement to keep the ability for the DHCPv6 server
   infrastructure to retain the ability of sending the RECONFIGURE
   message, this state needs to be kept across the server crashes and
   reboots.

   FIXME: Further experimentation needed to test how it actually works
   in real life implementations.

   Also, stateless DHCPv6 can not assign addresses to hosts.

   jinmei@wide.ad.jp: If you mean the Delayed Authentication Protocol by
   DHCPv6 authentication, the WIDE DHCPv6 supports it: http://
   sourceforge.net/projects/wide-dhcpv6/ although I myself have only
   used it in testing.  I heard some other vendors implemented it, too.
   (And, for that matter, it also supports the Information Refresh Time
   option (RFC4242)).

2.7.  Involvement or not into routing

   RAs have to be sent out by the routers themselves.  This makes them
   more robust to misconfiguration: in DHCP, if server is several hops
   away it will not know what routers are on the link - requiring manual
   entry and potential mistakes.  It is true that this does not seem to
   happen often in IPv4, but we can assume it is the case because a typo
   results in an immediate hard failure which gets fixed very quick.
   Fate sharing avoids this problem entirely.

Internet-Draft          RA and DHCPv6 comparison           December 2013


   To a large extent, RAs share fate with the routers that send them;
   for example, if a router loses power, then it will stop sending RAs.
   It's true that we address this in IPv4, by using protocols like VRRP.

2.8.  Server locality

   Both DHCPv6 and RA are inherently link-local mechanisms, however
   DHCPv6 has a means to "jump" over multiple hops by use of relays.
   This means RA *has* to be distributed, while DHCPv6 can be both
   centralized and distributed.  Frequently it is made centralized
   because of other benefits that centralized administration brings, but
   almost any router today can run a DHCPv6 server itself with very
   little problems.

2.9.  Programming: UDP vs. ICMP

   The programming difficulty is a somewhat subjective topic.  On one
   hand, one can say ICMP is harder to implement than UDP; it often
   requires raw sockets or kernel collaboration (e.g., on Linux RDNSS
   information can be read using netlink.  UDP is much simpler).  On the
   other hand, stateful DHCPv6 can be arguably a more complicated
   protocol to implement than RAs, with more message types and so on.

   On the other hand, it could be argued down to a choice of API:
   writing programs handling RA options like RDNSS is no harder than
   writing DHCPv6 client in terms of the socket API.  As long as the
   system supports RFC3542 you should be able to write a portable RA
   "client" pretty easily (meaning as easy/hard as writing some UDP
   client program).  For example, FreeBSD's rtsold supports RDNSS and
   (AFAIK) only relies on the RFC3542 APIs.  Also, since DHCP is
   trickier than other UDP applications in some points (it's more
   sensitive to which interface to use, and in some cases you need to
   make sure the source address is link-local, etc), it's quite likely
   that you'll need something like unusual APIs like RFC3542 or some
   non-portable system dependent interface to write a standard-compliant
   DHCP(v6) client.  So, overall, I'd say the programming difficulty
   regarding UDP (DHCP) vs ICMP (RS/RA) is marginal.

   In summary, it is probably fair to say that the "difficulty" in this
   context equates to "unfamiliarity" in some respects, and "protocol
   complexity" in others.

2.10.  IPAM tools impact comparison

   This is an indirect dependency, resulting in the centralized vs.
   distributed nature of DHCPv6 vs. RA.  IPAM tools' integration with
   DHCP is fairly well understood for IPv4.  When using RA, however, the
   IPAM can not track the addresses used.  Of course, the larger subnet

Internet-Draft          RA and DHCPv6 comparison           December 2013


   addressing space of IPv6 might in some cases transform the work
   performed by the IPAM systems from tracking the individual hosts
   towards tracking the subnets.  However, the host tracking needs to
   still be performed in some situations, and correlating the addresses
   with the hosts may be harder.

   This said, until very recently DHCPv6 replaced the MAC address with
   DUID - which created its own set of challenges.

2.11.  Security tools impact comparison

   From Brian Carpenter.  For further discussion.

3.  Arguments for running only a single protocol

   The "Comparison" section aims to highlight the various differences,
   and implicitly show the reasoning to have two protocols implemented
   in the nodes.  This section enumerates the reasons for a network
   operator to strongly prefer having only one of these two protocols in
   operation on the network at any point in time.

3.1.  Support and Security Complexity

   The requirement to run two protocols at the same time securely
   results in the need to snoop both of them - for effective source
   address validation.  Some vendors are unable to handle both at once.
   This means operators are very exposed to rogue RAs and rogue DHCPv6
   packets flying around networks.

   FIXME: To discuss further with Nick / other operators.  Basic
   protection should be doable with just a simple PACL - which should
   work at once for both protocols.

4.  Differences between different types of network operators

   Mostly placeholder, to capture the different requirements from
   various different network profiles (home-like zeroconf network, rural
   type network, university campus, enterprise, bank, ISP, etc.).

5.  Conclusion

   This document has attempted to show that both DHCPv6 and RA based
   configuration mechanisms have their unique strengths and weaknesses,
   and each of them may be "the best" depending on the environment for a
   particular network.

   Therefore host stacks which expect to maximize their chances of
   connectivity when moving between different networks will achieve this

Internet-Draft          RA and DHCPv6 comparison           December 2013


   best by implementing both mechanisms - else they might end up lacking
   essential configuration parameters if the network supplies those
   parameters using the mechanism that is not implemented.

   Networks may adopt a similar approach of attempting to support both
   mechanisms at once, to try to accomodate the "single-minded" hosts -
   but doing so usually incurs overhead, which should be evaluated by
   the network administrators.

6.  Musings on further protocol directions in IETF

   FIXME: To discuss: do we define spheres of influence for SLAAC/RA and
   DHCPv6, with strictly limited overlap, or do we try to make them
   equipotent, with a shared data model for their options ?
